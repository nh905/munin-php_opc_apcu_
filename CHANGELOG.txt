2021-05-12 improved autoconf error message
  php_opc_apcu_
    - added $url to the error message if the plugin does not receive a valid response from the monitored server 

2021-05-11 initial release
  opc_apcu_info.php
    - based on apc_info.php (https://github.com/vivid-planet/munin-php-apc/)
    - changed APC calls to PHP OpCache
    - separated out APCU logic since it is now independent of PHP OpCache

  php_opc_apcu_
    - based on php_apc_ (https://github.com/vivid-planet/munin-php-apc/)
    - updated graph names and variables to be consistent with PHP OpCache
    - moved the $custom_name to the front of the graph name so all graphs for one target are together
    - replaced code that mapped input to output variables with a lookup table
